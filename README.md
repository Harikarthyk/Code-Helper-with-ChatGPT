# VS Code Code Helper Extension

The VS Code Code Helper Extension provides helpful features to assist you with code-related tasks, such as explaining code, generating test cases, refactoring code, and adding comments to methods. It leverages the power of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 language model to provide intelligent suggestions and automate repetitive tasks.

## Features

- **Explain Code**: This feature allows you to select a piece of code and get a simplified explanation of the code in simple words.

- **Generate Test Case**: With this feature, you can select a code snippet and automatically generate a test case for that code.

- **Refactor Code**: The extension can refactor and optimize your code by suggesting improvements and optimizations. It can also add comments to explain the code.
